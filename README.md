# Systems Programming .. in Go!

This an exploration of systems programming in Go.

I'm following the [Systems Programming in Go](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/go-systems-programming) book.

Code is contained with the following directories:

* `algorithms`: Many algorithms written in Go (quicksort, etc)
* `utilities`: Unix utilities written in Go (cp, mv, ls, etc)
